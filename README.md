Who am I? What are my interests?

My name is Joe Howard Marsh, I am a Data Analyst and looking forward to progressing in my career.
My interests are wide ranging from UK housing and crime statistics, COVID 19 disease spread, cryptocurrency market and worldwide/nationwide demographics.
I'm passionate about critical thinking and scepticism and want to apply my knowledge in these fields to analysis of data.
I believe data can be used to make the world a better place by making data-driven decisions that can impact the world in a positive way.


Methods and Tools

I use inferential, descriptive statistics and machine learning algorithms to find insights in data.
I use Python's matplotlib and seaborn for data visualisations in Python, I also use Tableau for data vizzes and have achieved the Tableau Desktop Specialist Certification.
I code mostly in Python (using Jupyter and Pycharm) and SQL (using MySQL and SSMS - SQL Server Management Studio).
Within Python I use libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn and Tensorflow for my work.
I am also learning to use Git (for using Github properly)
In my current role I use SAS, Microsoft SQL, Excel macros, Linux and bespoke software within my company.
